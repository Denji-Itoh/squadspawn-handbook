# Player Movement

- Per round of combat, which would be 5s, your Speed is 4m + your current level. 
- You can jump your current level in meters high. So on your third level, you can jump 3 meters high. 
- You receive fall damage as soon as you fall from higher than two times your jump height. The amount of damage is calculated as 1d6 + additional 1d6 per doubled jump height. So if you can jump 2m high, you receive 1d6 fall damage as soon as you fall 4m. If you fall 8m, you receive 2d6, for 12m 3d6, and so on.
