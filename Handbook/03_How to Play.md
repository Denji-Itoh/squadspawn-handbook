# HOW TO PLAY

## Measurement and Numbers
Distances are measured using the metric system. Your character takes up a field of 1m² and their movement speed is also measured in metres, for example. 
Some abilities and values scale up e.g. 2,5d6 per level. What this means is that on the first level you gain with this ability you gain 2d6, and on the second level you gain 3d6. This is a test and might be changed, it is currently an important way to counter immense differences in power scaling down the line. 

## Skill Checks
Everything that is hard to do or needs some sort of skill needs a dice roll. You usually only use the twenty-sided dice if you’re outside combat. In combat, you additionally use six-sided dices for damage. More about that is written in the *Combat Encounters* chapter. 
- If you make a skill check you roll the aforementioned d20 and add whatever amount of points you've spent on that skill during your character creation. You should spend your skill points based on what playstyle you have and the type of character you built. 
- A naturally rolled 1 will always mean you failed the check, and a naturally rolled 20 will always mean you succeeded. 
- You might gain advantage or disadvantage on some skill checks based on your race and class options. If you have advantage, simply roll your check two times and pick the best result. For rolls with a disadvantage, pick the worse outcome. 
- If you gain advantage two times because of a certain combination of options for your character, add a +3 bonus to the roll instead of rolling more than two times. If you gain disadvantage two times, you get a -3 penalty instead. 
- If you fail a check, your GM decides how long it takes until you try again. 

There are the following 17 skills, the first 5 are *Combat Skills*, whereas *Ability* can also be used outside of combat: 
* Ranged Attack – How proficient are you with long-ranged weapons? (bows, rifles, etc.)
* Close-Combat Attack – How experienced are you in close-combat? (swords, staffs, etc.)
* Defence – Can you take a hit without getting hurt? (This is a defender check that will be used for attacks you're not aware of or that cover a wide are of effect.)
* Dexterity – Are you more of a fast-moving type and prefer dodging hits? (This is a defender check that also affects your initiative roll.)
* Ability – How good can you handle your birth-given powers? (This is also used outside of combat.)

* Movement – How fast are you when it comes down to it? 
* Observance – Do you have a good sense of what’s happening around you?
* Stealth – How proficient are you in sneaking (and maybe stealing)?
* Strength – How strong are you physically? How sturdy are you?
* Empathize – Do you understand how other people feel? Or maybe know when they lie? 
* Focus – Can you detect an enemy's presence easily? Can you ignore bad conditions?
* Knowledge – How much do you know about the world you’re in and how it works?
* Intelligence – How smart are you? Can you put puzzle-pieces together easily?
* Charisma – How trustful are you? How much do other people like you?
* Intimidation - How frightening is your presence? Can you put people under pressure easily?
* First Aid – Would you know how to help a friend that just collapsed? 
* Tinker – Can you tinker with old things to create new inventions? 





## Action Economy
Action Economy is the term used to describe what you can make your character do over the course of a full round. It is usually ignored unless necessary due to stressful situations or characters acting against each other in a combat encounter. One turn takes 5s. 

These are the type of actions available to your character: 
* Main Action: With this action type you can launch attacks, grapple or disarm an enemy, attempt to pick locks or use half your movement (rounded down) again. You can also try and end certain conditions with your main action. It's also possible to use the Help Action to give an ally advantage on a roll, or the Sabotage Action to give a creature disadvantage on a roll. 
* Bonus Action: With your bonus action you can, depending on your race and class choices, sometimes do additional things on your turn. Every Bonus Action activity can also be performed as a Main Action. 
* Interaction: You can interact with one item. This includes opening doors, windows, grabbing things out of your backpack and such. It doesn't include any activity that'd require a check or is otherwise ruled as too time expensive by your GM, such as picking locks. 
* Reaction: You can take the Help Reaction when an ally is about to be hit with an attack, or make an Opportunity Attack when an enemy is leaving your melee range of 1m. Depending on your race and class you might gain additional activities to do as your Reaction. 
* Movement: The amount of movement your character can make without taking the Dash action is decided by your level and class. For more information on movement, check out the *Movement* chapter. 


## Combat Encounters
### General Combat Rules 
* Combat is turn-based, with an Initiative Roll deciding the turn order. That roll is made with a Dexterity check. 
* The higher your check is, the earlier you can start your turn. If you were the one to initiate combat however, you have advantage on your Initiative Roll. 
* If characters have no way of knowing that someone's trying to attack them, they have to roll with disadvantage. That way when combat starts, people can react before the first shot is fired, but it's difficult.
* You can ready any of your Main or Bonus actions on a certain condition. Until your next turn starts, when your condition is met, you will perform that action. The wording has to be precise and edge cases are decided by the GM. 
* You're allowed to hold your entire turn, which will permanently put your initiative down for that combat session. 

* When a creature attacks, they roll for their desired attack roll (Ranged or Close-Combat) and the target creature has to roll for their desired (or required) defender roll (Defence or Dexterity). The winner of the contest gets to describe the outcome and roll for an attack. 
* Field covering attacks can't be dodged with a Dexterity roll. If you're inevitably hit, you have to roll for Defence. 
* If you're unaware of an attack and thus couldn't dodge it, you're also forced to use your Defence score. 
* Both Attack and Damage rolls are made once per attack, not per creature hit by the attack in the case of field covering attacks. 
* You can talk freely during combat, but interactions with each other and the enemy will be limited or interrupted by the GM, as combat continues. 
* If you die, you either lose or gain a skill point at your DM's discretion. 

### NPC Combat Rules
* Regular NPCs generally cannot perform the Help Reaction. 
* Legendary NPCs might be able to perform the Help Reaction. 




## Conditions

### Invisibility
* An invisible creature is not 100% imperceptible. They create sounds, smell, leave footprints or have rustling equipment, and they still emit aura, which other creatures can detect passively or actively. 
* An invisible creature can't receive the Help Reaction, as it is too difficult to keep track of their location and status passively while in a fight. 
* A creature can try and discover the location or presence of an invisible creature, making either an Observance vs. Stealth or a Focus vs. Ability contest, at the choice of the initiator. If the contest is won by the initiator, they can now target the invisible creature for an attack and know of their presence. 
* The invisible creature can make their defender check with advantage. 
* If an invisible creature is hit, they have to roll a Focus check vs. the attacker's initial attack roll. On a fail, they turn visible. 
* Invisible creatures have advantage on attacks rolls.

## Recovery
Once in a while you will need to take some time to tend to your wounds, recover your strength and calm yourself from the heat of combat. Such a break is defined as a Rest and is bound to the following rules: 
* A rest must take at least three hours. 
* You can't perform any physically or mentally taxing tasks during your rest. 
Doing so will reset the time you need until your rest is finished again. 
* You should mention when you're about to start your rest. 
* You can also ask if you've received a rest in hindsight of downtime your characters experienced - if the GM allows for it. 
* Additionally to resting, your characters also need to sleep once in a while. Having a sleepless night will give you *Exhaustion*, which will give you disadvantage on any check you make. Exhaustion can stack and give you a cumulative -3 penalty additionally to your initial disadvantage. 

### First Aid Kits
In your adventures you might stumble upon first aid kits. With each of these kits, you can heal 2d6 hit points before you run out of equipment, as these are merely used for the most necessary treatment before you can take a proper rest. They take two combat rounds to apply and you can only carry one at a time. They are not related to a First Aid skill check to stabilize a creature.
