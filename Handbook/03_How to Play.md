# HOW TO PLAY

## Measurement and Numbers
Distances are measured using the metric system. Your character takes up a field of 1m² and their movement speed is also measured in metres, for example. 
Some abilities and values scale up e.g. 2,5d6 per level. What this means is that on the first level you gain with this ability you gain 2d6, and on the second level you gain 3d6. This is a test and might be changed, it is currently an important way to counter immense differences in power scaling down the line. 

## Skill Checks
Everything that is hard to do or needs some sort of skill needs a dice roll. You usually only use the twenty-sided dice if you’re outside combat. In combat, you additionally use six-sided dices for damage. More about that is written in the *Combat Encounters* chapter. 
- If you make a skill check you roll the aforementioned d20 and add whatever amount of points you've spent on that skill during your character creation. You should spend your skill points based on what playstyle you have and the type of character you built. 
- A naturally rolled 1 will always mean you failed the check, and a naturally rolled 20 will always mean you succeeded. 

There are the following 17 skills, the first 5 being relevant for combat: 
* Ranged Attack – How proficient are you with long-ranged weapons? (bows, rifles, etc.)
* Close-Combat Attack – How experienced are you in close-combat? (swords, staffs, etc.)
* Defence – Can you take a hit without getting hurt? (This will be used for attacks you're not aware of or that cover a wide are of effect.)
* Dexterity – Are you more of a fast-moving type and prefer dodging hits? (This also affects your initiative roll.)
* Ability – How good can you handle your birth-given powers? (This is also used outside of combat.)

* Movement – How fast are you when it comes down to it? 
* Observance – Do you have a good sense of what’s happening around you?
* Stealth – How proficient are you in sneaking (and maybe stealing)?
* Strength – How strong are you physically? How sturdy are you?
* Empathize – Do you understand how other people feel? Or maybe know when they lie? 
* Focus – Can you detect an enemy's presence easily? Can you ignore bad conditions?
* Knowledge – How much do you know about the world you’re in and how it works?
* Intelligence – How smart are you? Can you put puzzle-pieces together easily?
* Charisma – How trustful are you? How much do other people like you?
* Intimidation - How frightening is your presence? Can you put people under pressure easily?
* First Aid – Would you know how to help a friend that just collapsed? 
* Tinker – Can you tinker with old things to create new inventions? 

- You can spend points on these skills when creating your character. If you choose to spend all of your points on dexterity and just keep dodging enemy attacks, so be it. 
- If there is an enemy with an attack covering a wide area, you are not able to dodge and thus have to take the hit with the defence option. So you might be more keen to that. On the other hand when rolling for the order of initiative in an encounter, you're using your Combat Dexterity value for the roll. As you see, pretty much every skill is needed at some point, so choose wisely. 
- A character who is unbeatable in dodging but has zero movement or observance isn't realistic. Your GM should check your picked skills and decide if they fit your character. There are no boundaries so you can be who you want, not so you can break the game. But feel free to try and break the game, considering that. 
- You might gain advantage or disadvantage on some skill checks based on your race and class options. If you have advantage, simply roll your check two times and pick the best result. For rolls with a disadvantage, pick the worse outcome. 
- If you gain advantage two times because of a certain combination of options for your character, add a +3 bonus to the roll instead of rolling more than two times. If you gain disadvantage two times, you get a -3 penalty instead. 
- If you fail a check, your GM decides how long it takes until you try again. 




## Combat Encounters
### General Combat Rules 
* Combat is turn-based, with an Initiative Roll deciding the turn order. That roll is made with a Dexterity check. 
* The higher your check is, the earlier you can start your turn. If you were the one to initiate combat however, you have advantage on your Initiative Roll. If the enemies have no way of knowing that you're trying to attack them, they have to roll with disadvantage. Same goes for player characters. You can still come last even if you wanted to surprise someone, but on the other side of that spectrum you can also realize someone is trying to attack you from a hidden location because you felt their presence or heard their weaponry. 
* One turn of combat takes 5s. 
* You have a certain amount of actions during your turn in combat that you can take if you want to, depending on your class and level. 
⋅⋅* Action: In your action you can either attack someone, interact with something, take the Dash action to move half your movement speed again (rounded down), take the Disengage action to move out of your enemies' range without causing opportunity attacks, try and disarm your enemy or grapple them, roll for Stealth to hide yourself from enemies, or something similar that might come to mind. 
⋅⋅* Interaction: You can interact with one object. 
⋅⋅* Reaction: You can use your Reaction for an opportunity attack if an enemy decides to leave your close-combat attack range, or use the Help Reaction to give a friend advantage on a roll they're making, or an enemy disadvantage on an attack roll against. 

* You can ready any of these actions or your movement on a certain condition. For the rest of this turn, when your condition is met, you will perform that action. The wording has to be precise and edge cases are decided by the DM. 
* If an enemy decides to attack you, they roll for their desired attack roll, and you roll for either Defence or Dexterity. Whoever wins the contest gets to describe the outcome. 
* If you decide to attack an enemy, you roll for for your desired attack roll, which can be either a Ranged Attack, a Close-Combat Attack or an Ability check, and your enemy rolls for their desired counter roll. Whoever wins the contest gets to describe the outcome. 
* Field covering attacks can't be dodged with a Dexterity roll. If you're inevitably hit, you have to roll for Defence. Both Attack and Damage rolls are made once per attack, not per creature hit by the attack. 
* If you're unaware of an attack and thus couldn't dodge it, you're also forced to use your Defence score. 
* If you die, you either lose or gain a skill point at your DM's discretion. 
* You're allowed to hold your turn to sync your actions with another player, which will permanently put your initiative down for that combat session. 
* Enemies have the same action economy as you.  
* You can talk freely during combat, but interactions with each other and the enemy will be limited or interrupted by the GM, as combat continues. 

### NPC Combat Rules
* Regular NPCs generally cannot perform the Help reaction. 
* Legendary NPCs might be able to perform the Help reaction. 

### Invisibility Rules
* Through the power of the Shin or special items, it is possible for combatants to turn invisible. The following special rules apply in these scenarios. 
* You're invisible, but not 100% imperceptible. You create sounds, smell, leave footprints or have rustling equipment. And you still emit aura, which enemies can detect passively or actively. You are granted with certain benefits however, as you're simply harder to nail down, especially while in ranged combat. 
* If you're invisible, enemies can either contest their Observance vs. your Stealth, or their Focus vs. your Ability check without taking up any actions, but only once per turn. If they win the contest, they can attack you and know where you are, until the start of your turn. Ranged weapons have disadvantage on these attacks. 



## RECOVERY
Once in a while you will need to take some time to tend to your wounds, recover your strength and calm yourself from the heat of combat. Such a break is defined as a Rest and is bound to the following rules: 
* A rest must take at least three hours. 
* You can't perform any physically or mentally taxing tasks during your rest. 
Doing so will reset the time you need until your rest is finished again. 
* You should mention when you're about to start your rest. 
* You can also ask if you've received a rest in hindsight of downtime your characters experienced - if the GM allows for it. 
* Additionally to resting, your characters also need to sleep once in a while. Having a sleepless night will give you *Exhaustion*, which will give you disadvantage on any check you make. Exhaustion can stack and give you a cumulative -3 penalty additionally to your initial disadvantage. 

### First Aid Kits
In your adventures you might stumble upon first aid kits. With each of these kits, you can heal 2d6 hit points before you run out of equipment, as these are merely used for the most necessary treatment before you can take a proper rest. They take two combat rounds to apply and you can only carry one at a time. They are not related to a First Aid skill check to stabilize a creature.
