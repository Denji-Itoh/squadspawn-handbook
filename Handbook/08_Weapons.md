# Weapons

* Ranged weapons deal 1d6 damage per hit, no matter what type. Reloading happens outside of the action economy, but is welcome to be described as flavour during combat. 
* Close-combat weapons deal 1d6 damage per hit, no matter what type. 
* Fighting close-combat gives you a +2 modifier on Dexterity and Defence checks as you're harder to hit. 
* Damage scales up as 1d6 per level. 
* You can use parts of your body as close-combat weapons, but it has to be the main fighting style of your character. If you usually fight with weapons, your body counts as an improvised weapon. 
* Improvised weapons (e.g. a bottle from the bar you grabbed out of necessity) behave similar to regular weapons, but the damage you rolled for will be halved, rounded up. 
* Stationary weapons, such as heavy mounted machine guns, apply 1d6 additional damage and have a +2 bonus to hit. 
* Grenades have a range of 3m and apply 1d6 points of damage per level you have. You can throw them 4m far, plus your current level and your Strength skill modifier.
