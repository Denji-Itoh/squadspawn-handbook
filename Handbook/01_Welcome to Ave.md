# Welcome to Ave

A world that is best described as manifested chaos. This is a dystopian, ever-changing place where only the strong can survive. A world where death has more than one layer, all of which you may experience. Because dying in this world does not mean the end. 
But for now, what is Ave like? Chaotic, for short. You may walk through an ice desert for ten kilometres, then find a rainforest directly attached to it. Basic geography doesn’t really apply here. You can find flying mountains, fiery stone deserts or blood-red water with subnautic ruins in some places. Remember back when you were a child and drew blue horses because they looked cool? It didn’t make much sense, but that didn’t stop you. Think of Ave as the mind of such a child, manifesting what it feels like in the moment. 

-----------------------

## TECHNOLOGY

Technology is quite advanced, at least weapon-wise. Computers are there, but not used on a daily basis since surviving in itself is hard enough already. So technological standards reach from medieval to steampunk and all the way to sci-fi depending on where you are. Tele- or wireless communication does not exist, however. The most advanced way to send messages across distance is through doves or letters. And since those aren’t too safe, message deliveries are preferably done in person. There's a whole network of Kami, also called "Lightborns", who specialize in transmitting information across the three main continents of Ave. 
Technological standards are roughly the same for weapons and locations; Crossbows, Laser-guns, lightsabres, catapults, fortresses, big and modern cities, slums, everything. You could walk through a renaissance-themed city for three hours and end up at the Empire State building directly in the middle of it. Everything exists simultaneously. In the end, Ave could be described as a fantasy-influenced steam- to cyber-punk dystopia. You never know what you may find, and however exciting this must sound like for you – it tends to be a problem. 

-----------------------

## SAFE ZONES AND THE UNSET
You can overall categorize Ave into two kinds of areas: The set and the unset. In set areas, also generally known as “safe zones”, a city stays where and how it is. There simply are no changes to it that people don’t make. In an unset area, regular so-called geo-storms kill everything in it and leave a new kind of biome behind. Unset areas can’t be mapped, since even the highest mountains can disappear overnight sometimes. If your party ever happens to see such a storm in the distance, you should probably run to the nearest set area, which are mostly cities or villages, and wait it out. 
The unset areas hide great treasure, however. In it appear resources such as food, fuel, batteries, weapons, and more. The structures that these resources come with are the single source of all that is valued within Ave. But as they're no safe place to stay in for too long, and the most unregulated place in the world, they're mostly no fun to be in and only live in if one can't afford life in a safe zone. 

-----------------------

## INHABITANTS

This world is inherited by humanoids that are split into ten different races, whereas their respective type dictates the powers they get by birth and personal development. But we’ll get to that again at a later point in time. 
The people from Ave live about as long as humans, while their appearance could be that of a fourteen-year-old when they actually have lived for eighty years. They themselves, much like the world they’re in, manifest their inside to the outside, if you will. Their body, clothes, weapons, all a manifestation. 
Their sturdiness, speed and strength is also based upon their inner strength. Higher ups can usually jump up on high buildings, smash each other through entire city blocks or crack open mountains with their raw physical strength, depending on how strong and experienced they are. 
Reproduction works similarly - based on will. Conception isn't made without the intent for it, which is one of the reasons - additionally to a generalized single-child rule and the hardships that come with raising a child in a world like Ave - why population doesn't grow exponentially but stays mostly stagnant. And if it wouldn't be, conditions would gradually grow worse because of the already existing spatial issues people faced with the little amount of set zones, which would in turn decrease reproduction rates. Depending on where you live, there might even be laws regulating how many childs you're allowed to give birth to. These laws aren't frowned upon however, as generally everyone knows what a huge problem overpopulation is in Ave already. 
Regarding lifestyle, usually people will travel in small groups through the world or settle down in set areas and try to make a living there, though space is rare and pricey in cities, and the environment remains dangerous in more rural areas. 
Each inhabitant speaks the same language and trades the same coin, which is measured in Gold. Living costs range from 10-100 gold per day depending on where you live. 
You can find out more about all the different inhabitants in the "Races" chapter.

## YOU WILL DIE

Another important thing to note down; people fight. This world is far from peaceful, and there’s no generalized type of police or guard-system to ensure your safety. You will have to fight or talk your way out of troubles, as there is no common law that will prevent anyone from taking all that you have. You can earn insurance through respect or work to make people have your back for you, if you want to, or just fight your way through all your obstacles solo. 
One thing I can promise you already, however, is that down the line you’ll die. And it won’t be the end, as you will come back again, either stronger or weaker, depending on the circumstances. The inhabitants of this world perish by age, before that they are essentially immortal, manifesting back to life after falling to ash when they are killed. That process of rebirth can take either a minute or a month, entirely dependant on how it all went down. That sounds unpredictable and scary, and honestly, it is. Even to the inhabitants, the chaotic ways of their world are just another thing they have to accept, because they can do nothing about it. 
People in Ave spend their free time talking and fighting, exploring and hunting. There are concerts, arena battles, sports and even schools. But it all is a bit more chaotic than it is in your world, less restricted, more brutal and generally rough around the edges. 

I mentioned earlier how people only die of age, so I should probably dive a little deeper into that for a minute. Once you're around 70 to 80 years old, you start to develope a sickness, the "shimmer", as people call it. It starts as a small, harmless little white spot on your skin. As time goes by, that spot grows bigger, enveloping more and more of your body. It starts to limit your movement and cripple your mind. Not everyone is affected the same way, but the loss of strength and focus is inevitable for all. But worst of all - they gradually lose their ability of rebirth. 
By the time an inhabitant dies, the "shimmer" has enveloped their whole body. If someone kills them off, they remain gone, with no way to manifest their body back to life. Even if they manage to stay alive after that, eventually the shimmer itself will eat away the sick host, slowly causing its body to fall apart, leaving nothing but white ash. 
The shimmer is the horrible fate awaiting each and every one of the inhabitants of Ave. 

-----------------------

## LIFE IN AVE 

Life in Ave is generally simple to the point where you only need to be good at one of two things; talk or fight your way out of sticky situations. 

As you can't die for good, society is a little different than yours. Law enforcement, scholarships, all depending on region, alliance, and more.
Since you can't even starve to death (though food is definitely still eaten as a culinary experience), working for food isn't the main purpose of each inhabitant, more so people try to get stronger by themselves or get a good amount of friends that will protect them if need be. Even though you can't really die, being killed is no fun. It's weakining, to say the least.

Regarding money, the only currency is gold. In the following list you have some examples for values of certain goods and services. 
1G --> Most groceries
5G --> A round of beer for the whole group
40G --> A night at the local tavern or a hotel

See the following list as a further introduction into what it's like to be an inhabitant of Ave. 
Students: As a student, you'll want to study under a personal teacher or master of yours, or in an institute within a safe zone that's more or less regulated and keeps you safe until you're of a certain age. But you don't get anywhere for free - you have to pay with service, or have someone else do that part for you. Because of that, most parents go to war at one point or another and serve as cannon fodder, to make sure their child receives much needed downtime from the horrors of the outside world in an institute that keeps them safe and educated so they have a good head start on everyone else who can't afford it. 
Gang Member: If you want some sort of protection in your adult life, you'll want to become part of something greater than you. A street gang, organization or group of people strong enough to scare people off with their name - and follow through if need be. Almost everyone considers themselves to be part of some sort of group, though there's too many options out there to list them here. 
Alliance Member: This right here offers you the greatest amount of protection you can receive as a regular inhabitant. If you're part of an alliance, you're mostly secure within your own race to not be killed off out of fun, as this is essentially the single greates group of people currently in power of an entire race and it's capital. However it makes you a target for a lot of other alliance members out there, if they're at war with you. So as with everything, this is a give and take. A lot of people dodge joining their alliance because of the responsibilities, to be faced with even greater threats once the doors to their capital are shut for them. 
Scrappers and Scouts: These right here are the most quintessential part of the economy in Ave. They search for structures in the wild and bring back anything of value, making money off of it and equipping people within safe zones with much needed resources and gear. This would be the equivalent of a 9-to-5 job in Ave. 
Shop Keeper: If you own a shop or a bar, scrappers and scouts sell you goods to restock your inventory, so you can further sell it to the highest bidder. As a shop keeper you're faced with lots of issues on a day to day basis, from blackmailing to random fights destroying your shop time after time again. But if you're picking the right people as your friends, you can become a hotspot for them and receive great amounts of protection. 
Nomad: Space in cities is scarce, to say the very least. Living there is just too expensive for most people, which is why so many from the city get kicked out each year, not being able to pay their alliance in control the money needed. So, naturally, the unset areas are an unavoidable alternative for most people. You have to be on constant high alert for raids from hostile groups, monsters attacking your camp, or geo-storms appearing. You have to battle your environment and search for resources in the vast lands of Ave, and fight your way through life.

## POLITICS

The world of Ave is experiencing a shift in power about once in a year. That might seem like a very frequent event, and in all honesty, it is. Every few years an alliance is completely reformed by their current leader and their personal views, and a single fight between two or more of them can create a power vacuum big enough to cause chaos for years to follow. Right now however, we're in the middle of a longer, more stable period. The Kara and Dree keep to themselves, the Ness and Taro remain unbothered by the alliances around them. The Ahri and Zen keep up friendly relations and the Kami are as necessary as always. 

That doesn't mean there aren't any developments worth worrying about though. There's been talks about the Arno being ruled by a more aggressive king lately, Daeron, and the Shin have been slowly preparing for war for the past few years under the command of their queen, Vee. And the Ragin, unpredictable as always and a common aggressor for conflict, have been seemingly preparing for battle as well under their new king Raku.
