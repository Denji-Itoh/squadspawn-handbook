# Welcome to Ave

A world that is best described as chaos incarnate, this is a dystopian, ever-changing place where only the strong can survive. *A world where death is not the end*. 
Ave is unpredictable - you may walk through an ice desert for an hour, only to find a rainforest directly attached to it. There's medieval structures in flying mountains, lakes filled with blood, skyscrapers buried underground. Much like a child drawing blue horses, Ave is similarly capable of manifesting the unreal.

## TECHNOLOGY

The technological standards depend on the place you currently are. Ave manifests different places and times, reaching from medieval strongholds to futuristic mega cities, and within each of these places are items, vehicles and weapons befitting their surroundings. 
As such, you're able to find lightsabers and crossbows, rocket launchers and catapults. 
Tele- or wireless communcations don't exist, at least not over long distances, as Ave is regularly restructuring its environment, putting all efforts to build systems like these to ashes. The most advanced ways of relaying information is found in letters carried out by the world's inhabitants. 
Everything exists simultaneously and resources are more often found than crafted. There's barely reason to mine for iron when there are fully operational guns out in the world, waiting to be found. 

## SAFE ZONES AND THE UNSET

Ave can be categorized into two types of areas; the *set* and the *unset*. 
- In set areas, also generally known as *safe zones*, a city stays where and how it is. There simply are no changes to it that people don’t make. These zones are commonly used to build towns where people are safe from what lies outside them. Space is limited however, and conflict is constant within the walls of a set area. 
- In an unset area, also referred to as *the outlands*, regular *super-storms* called *XXX* kill everything they hail across and leave a new biome behind. Unset areas can’t be mapped, since even the highest mountains can disappear overnight. If your party ever happens to see such a storm in the distance, you should probably run to the nearest set area and wait it out. Unset areas hide great treasure; resources such as food, fuel, batteries, weapons, and more. The structures that these resources come with are the single source of all that is valued within Ave. But as they're no safe place to stay in for too long, and the most unregulated place in the world, they're no fun to be in for a longer period of time. 

## INHABITANTS

This world is inherited by the *Aveans*, humanoids that are split into *ten different races*, whereas their respective race dictates the powers they get by birth and throughout their development. They all look the same on the outside, but their powers allow them to burn down cities or create matter out of thin air, depending on their heritage and power. 
- Ave's inhabitants live about as long as humans and look just the same, while their appearance could be that of a fourteen-year-old when they actually have lived for eighty years. They themselves, much like the world they’re in, manifest their inside to the outside, if you will. 
- Aveans cannot die. If one of them is killed, they will eventually return and manifest again, either in safe distance, at a place they know well or near people they trust well. This is describer in further detail in the *You Will Die* chapter
- Their sturdiness, speed and strength is also based upon their inner strength. Higher ups can usually jump up on high buildings, smash each other through entire city blocks or crack open mountains with their raw physical strength, depending on how strong and experienced they are. 
- Reproduction works similarly - based on will. Conception isn't made without the intent for it, which is one of the reasons - additionally to a generalized single-child rule and the hardships that come with raising a child in a world like Ave - why population doesn't grow exponentially but stays mostly stagnant. And if it wouldn't be, conditions would gradually grow worse because of the already existing spatial issues people are facing with the little amount of set zones, which would in turn decrease reproduction rates. Depending on where you live, there might even be laws regulating how many children you're allowed to give birth to. Much opposed to our world, these laws aren't frowned upon, as everyone knows what a huge problem overpopulation is in Ave already and how terrible it can get within just a few decades. 
- Regarding lifestyle, usually people will travel in small groups through the world or settle down in set areas and try to make a living there, though space is rare and pricey. 
- Each inhabitant speaks the same language and trades the same coin, which is measured in *gold*. Living costs range from 10-100 gold per day depending on where you live. 
You can find out more about all the different inhabitants in the *Races* chapter. 

## YOU WILL DIE

Inhabitants fight. This world is far from peaceful, and there’s no generalized type of police or guard-system to ensure your safety. You will have to fight or talk your way out of troubles, as there is no common law that will prevent anyone from taking all that you have. You can earn insurance through respect or work to make people have your back for you, if you want to, or just fight your way through all your obstacles solo. 
One thing that is certain already is that down the line you will - eventually - still die. But that won’t be the end, as you will come back again, either stronger or weaker, depending on the circumstances surrounding your death. 
- The inhabitants of this world only perish by age. Before that they are essentially immortal, manifesting back to life after falling to ash when they are killed. That process of rebirth can take either an hour or a month, entirely dependant on how it all went down. This is unpredictable and scary for every inhabitant of Ave, as even to them, the chaotic ways of their world are something they have simply learned to accept. 
- When you die, you enter the *void*, a name the inhabitants have given the state between death and rebirth. You feel time pass, but can sense nothing outside of that. Only dark nothingess and empty space. It's agonizing and something inhabitants truly wish to avoid. 
- Once you return from death, you're most likely weaker than before. The void has taken a toll on your body and mind and you need to recover from it. 

- Once you're around 70 to 80 years old, you start to develope a sickness, the *shimmer*, as people call it. It starts as a small, harmless white spot on your skin. As time goes by, that spot grows bigger, enveloping more and more of your body. It starts to limit your movement and cripple your mind. 
- Not everyone is affected the same way, but the loss of strength and focus is inevitable for all. And, probably worst of all, they gradually lose their ability of rebirth. 
- By the time an inhabitant dies, the "shimmer" has enveloped their whole body. If someone kills them off, they remain gone, with no way to manifest their body back to life. Even if they manage to stay alive after that, eventually the shimmer itself will eat away the sick host, slowly causing its body to fall apart, leaving nothing but white ash. 
- The shimmer is the horrible fate awaiting each and every one of the inhabitants of Ave. 

## MONSTERS

Ave is home to another set of creatures, entirely different from the ten humanoid races inhabiting it. These monster come in all shapes and sizes, dark as night and in high numbers. There are singular monsters who prefer to hunt alone, and there's hordes and swarms of them waiting for someone to enter unset areas. 
- There is little known about them, as there are countless types and they don't take being studied all too well. They're aggressive and sinister to the ten races and have made it their purpose to hunt them down. 
- They don't appear in safe zones and are usually kept out by the locals successfully. 
- Their blood is used to produce the drug *anti*. It needs to be harvested right after the kill. 
- That is because their bodies evaporate quickly after they die. 

## POLITICS

The world of Ave is experiencing a shift in power about once a year. Every few years an alliance is completely reformed by their current *monarch* and their personal views, and a single fight between two or more of them can create a power vacuum big enough to cause chaos for years to follow. The ever-changing politics don't give Ave's inhabitants much room to breathe in-between conflict. There are a set of rules that you can count on no matter what time your game is set in, though: 
- Monarchs usually rule their alliance alone. 
- An alliance usually only accepts members from their own race to join their ranks. 
- Each alliance is able to maintain one capital city. 
- Monarchs are regularly dethroned by their own alliance. These revolutions take time, effort, and often fail, leaving ehind a trail of blood and a monarch still in power. 
- The power gaps between the certain ranks within alliances is so huge that a few higher ups are able to achieve what armies can't. Some of the higher ups can be considered gods. 
- Depending on the campaign you play, the following data might be incorrect. It is adjusted to represent the beginning of the *Manifest* story arc. 

| Race | Monarch | Capital City |
| ---- | ---- | --------- |
| Kara | Glaive | Moore |
| Ragin | Raku | Sly |
| Dree | Ilsen | Hamon |
| Ness | Elleen | Farphine |
| Kami | Loomis | Thana |
| Arno | Daeron | Ailnor |
| Shin | Vee | Trael |
| Zen | Elar | Raeven |
| Taro | Pera | Vesstan |
| Ahri | Fae | Crest |

## LIFE IN AVE 

Life in Ave is generally simple to the point where you only need to be good at one of two things; talk or fight your way out of sticky situations. 

As you can't die for good, society works entirely different. Law enforcement, schooling systems, housing options, all depending on region, alliance, and more.
Since you can't even starve to death (though food is definitely still eaten as a culinary experience), working for food isn't the main purpose of each inhabitant, more so people try to get stronger by themselves or get a good amount of friends that will protect them if need be. 

Regarding money, the only currency is gold. In the following list you have some examples for values of certain goods and services. 
- 1G --> Most groceries
- 5G --> A round of beer for the whole group
- 50G --> A night at the local tavern or a hotel
- 500G --> A high end solar-powered laptop. 
- 5.000G --> A large van, already fueled up. 
- 50.000G --> A small one room apartment in a safe zone.
