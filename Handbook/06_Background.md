# BACKGROUNDS

Each character receives a background when being created. 
Your characterâ€™s background is a collection of characteristics that make them who they were before they joined or started the campaign. 
It consists of the following aspects and should receive a fitting name of your own choosing: 
* Skill Expertise: You're outstandingly good at certain things. Pick two skills to gain advantage with at all times. These skills cannot be combat skills. If you pick the Ability skill, you will only gain advantage outside of combat encounters. 
* Knowledge Expertise: Pick one of the following things that you have way more experience with than the average Avean. You can also come up with fields of your own. When asked to roll for something related to it, you can bring your Knowledge Expertise up and might gain Advantage or a lowered DC. Here are some that might spark some ideas: Combat Expertise, Set Areas, Unset Areas, Politics, Mechanics, Gangs, Monsters, Races, Authorities, Vehicles, Urban Legends, Fashion, Business, Psychology. 
* Equipment: You will receive extra equipment that you needed before in your life. It can cost up to 500G. NOTE: Because of the vast amount of possibilities, there is no concrete shopping list (yet). Talk to your DM about pricing. 
* Contacts: You gain two contacts that owe you a favor, and one contact that you owe something. They might be anywhere in the world. 
* Motivation: Decide on what drives your character. What do they wish to achieve? Why are they partying up with other aveans? 
* Fear: Decide on what your character is running from. What is it that they wish to avoid or forget about? What is their weakness? 
* Backstory: This should be a summary of your character's story so far and tie in with all of your current skills and ambitions.
