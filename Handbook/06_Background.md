# BACKGROUNDS

Each character receives a background when being created. 
Your characterâ€™s background is a collection of characteristics that make them who they were before they joined or started the campaign. 
It consists of the following aspects and should receive a fitting name: 
* Expertise: You're outstandingly good at certain things. Pick two skills to gain advantage with. These skills cannot be combat skills. If you pick the Ability skill, you will only gain advantage outside of combat encounters. 
* Equipment: You will receive extra equipment that you needed before in your life. It can cost up to 500G. 
* Experience: Pick one of the following things that you have way more experience with than the average Avean. You can also come up with fields of your own. Pre-written ones to spark ideas are: Combat Expertise, Set Areas, Unset Areas, Politics, Mechanics, Gangs, Monsters, Races, Authorities, Vehicles.
