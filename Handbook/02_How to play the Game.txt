::::: PEN AND PAPER :::::
This is a pen & paper roleplaying game. You make a character that you play as and travel through the partially pre-set world with fellow players, overcoming obstacles that your GM (Gamemaster) is putting in front of you and following a story-line that is partially pre-set and executed as well as completed by – again – your GM. 

The Gamemaster
So, he does most of the work - but he’s also the one in control. The GM is not limited to one character, since he can make you meet whoever he wants. And he is responsible for binding your character’s backstory into the main storyline and give you spotlight from time to time. He’s responsible for ensuring the players have fun, and making sure the story plays out nicely for everyone involved. A lot of responsibility, but also a lot of creativity that you can unleash onto your players, enchanting them in your world and your characters. 
Sounds interesting to you? In that case, you should read the Squadspawn GM handbook. 
But keep in mind; if you read it, you know everything about Ave. You know why things are the way they are. You may not be able to play the game the way a normal player can, or you need to roleplay that you don’t know anything about it. If you only want to GM on occasional times to give your usual GM a little break, though, you can just make your own characters or ask him what you are allowed to do without disturbing his ‘greater plan’. 

The Player Character
As a player, you should choose races and classes that suit you. You can roleplay a racist extremist if you want to, or have a whole group of clowns patrol the lanes of Ave. But optimally you play a character with a lot of depth to them, that you enjoy playing and that can handle serious things happening around them. You and your fellow players, you’re gonna be a team. The world is going to try and rip you all apart, and you must withstand that. Solo players usually get ripped apart by some part of Ave sooner or later. 
That does not mean that you can’t play a secretly evil character that stabs the rest of the crew in the back sometime down the line, but if you don’t give your character reason or interest in being in a group travelling the lands of Ave, then you’ll find yourself troubled playing the game.
So, long story short; play whatever you want, but keep in mind that this is at its core team-based, brutal and serious. If you play a class clown, the local tribe might not be too keen on your jokes. But, knowing that, feel free to be creative.

::::: SKILL CHECKS :::::
Everything that is hard to do or needs some sort of skill needs a dice roll. You usually only use the twenty-sided dice if you’re outside combat. In combat, you mainly use six-sided dices. More about that is written in the ‘Encounter’ chapter. 
If your character is a scout, he’s quiet and fast, so you have bonus points on rolls for stealth and movement. He doesn’t have too much armour on himself though, so on defence rolls in combat you won’t be able to add much points to your roll and have to take a hit more often because of that. So you should spend your skill points based on what playstyle you have. 

There are the following 17 skills, the first 5 being relevant for combat: 
· Ranged Attack – How proficient are you with long-ranged weapons? (bows, rifles, etc.)
· Close-Combat Attack – How experienced are you in close-combat? (swords, staffs, etc.)
· Defence – Can you take a hit without getting hurt? (first option when being attacked)
· Dexterity – Are you more of a fast-moving type and prefer dodging hits? (second option)
· Ability – How good can you handle your birth-given powers? (also used outside of combat)

· Movement – How fast are you when it comes down to it? 
· Observance – Do you have a good sense of what’s happening around you?
· Stealth – How proficient are you in sneaking (and maybe stealing)?
· Strength – How strong are you physically? How sturdy are you?
· Empathize – Do you understand how other people feel? Or maybe know when they lie? 
· Focus – Can you detect an enemy's presence easily? Can you ignore bad conditions?
· Knowledge – How much do you know about the world you’re in and how it works?
· Intelligence – How smart are you? Can you put puzzle-pieces together easily?
· Charisma – How trustful are you? How much do other people like you?
· Intimidation - How frightening is your presence? Can you put people under pressure easily?
· First Aid – Would you know how to help a friend that just collapsed? 
· Tinker – Can you tinker with old things to create new inventions? 

You can spend points on these skills when creating your character. On the first level, you have twenty points with the only boundary being 4+ your current level. If you choose to spend all of your points on dexterity and just keep dodging enemy attacks, so be it. But be reminded – if there is an enemy with an attack covering a wide area, you are not able to dodge and thus have to take the hit with the defence option. So you might be more keen to that. But when rolling for the order of initiative in an encounter, you're allowed to use your Combat Dexterity value for the roll. As you see, pretty much every skill is needed at some point, so choose wisely. 
Also, a character who is unbeatable in dodging but has zero movement or observance is illogical. Your GM should look over what skills you picked and decide if they fit your character. There are no boundaries so you can be who you want, not so you can break the game. But feel free to try and break the game, considering that. 
You might gain advantage or disadvantage on some skill checks based on your race and class options. If you have advantage, simply roll your check two times and pick the best result. For rolls with a disadvantage, pick the worse outcome. 
If you gain advantage two times because of a certain combination of options for your character, add a +3 bonus to the roll instead of rolling more than two times. If you gain disadvantage two times, you get a -3 penalty instead.

::::: COMBAT ENCOUNTERS :::::
:: General Combat Rules ::
· Combat is turn-based, with an Initiative Roll deciding the turn order. 
· If you want to start combat, you have to roll for Initiative with a Dexterity check. 
· The higher your check is, the earlier you can start your turn. If you were the one to initiate combat however, you have advantage on your Initiative Roll. If the enemies have no way of knowing that you're trying to attack them, they have to roll with disadvantage. Same goes for player characters. You can still come last even if you wanted to surprise someone, but you can also realize someone is trying to attack you from a hidden location because you felt their presence or heard their weaponry. 
· You have a certain amount of actions during your turn in combat that you can take if you want to. Depending on your class and level. 
	• 1 Action: In your action you can either 
		○ attack someone, 
		○ interact with something, 
		○ take the Dash action to move half your movement speed again (rounded down), 
		○ take the Disengage action to move out of your enemies' range without causing opportunity attacks, 
		○ try and disarm your enemy 
		○ or grapple them, 
		○ roll for Stealth to hide yourself from enemies, 
		○ or something similar that might come to mind. 
	• 1 Interaction: Additionally to your regular action, you can interact with one object with this type of action. 
	• 1 Reaction: You can use your Reaction for 
		○ an opportunity attack if an enemy decides to leave your close-combat attack range, 
		○ or use the Help Reaction to give a friend advantage on a roll they're making, or an enemy disadvantage on an attack roll against. 
· You can ready any of these actions or your movement on a certain condition. For the rest of this turn, when your condition is met, you will perform that action. The wording has to be precise and edge cases are decided by the DM. 
· If an enemy decides to attack you, they roll for their desired attack roll, and you roll for either Defence or Dexterity. If they win the contest, they hit you successfully and get to describe it. 
· If you decide to attack an enemy, you roll for for your desired attack roll, which can be either a Ranged Attack, a Close-Combat Attack or an Ability check, your enemy rolls for their desired counter roll. If you hit, you get to describe the outcome. 
· If you roll a Natural 1, you have to subtract 1d6 from your damage die pool for this attack. If you roll a Naturall 20, you gain 2d6. 
· Field covering attacks can not be dodged with a Dexterity roll. If you're inevitably hit, you have to roll for Defence. Both Attack and Damage rolls are made once per attack once per attack, not per creature hit by the attack. 
· If you're unaware of an attack and thus couldn't dodge it, you're also forced to use your Defence score. 
· If you die, you either lose or gain a skill point at your DM's discretion. 
· You're allowed to hold your turn to sync your actions with another player, which will permanently put your initiative down for that combat session. 
E.g. if you want to help someone jump higher to reach a platform, but that person comes after you, you can delay your initiative to give them your Help reaction and continue your turn right after they're done.
· Enemies have the same action economy as you.  
· You can talk freely during combat, but interactions with each other and the enemy will be limited or interrupted by the GM. 

:: NPC Combat Rules ::
· Regular NPCs generally cannot perform the Help reaction. 
· Legendary NPCs might be able to perform the Help reaction. 

:: Invisibility Rules ::
· Through the power of the Shin or special items, it is possible for combatants to turn invisible. The following special rules apply in these scenarios. 
· You're invisible, but not 100% imperceptible. You create sounds, smell, leave footprints or have rustling equipment. And you still emit aura, which enemies can detect passively or actively. You are granted with certain benefits however, as you're simply harder to nail down, especially while in ranged combat. 
· If you're invisible, enemies have disadvantage on opportunity attacks. 
· If you're invisible, enemies have disadvantage on ranged attacks made against you. This does not apply to melee attacks, as you're much easier to be perceived and hit by someone directly in front of you. 
· If an enemy is unaware of you, they have to roll their Observance vs. your Stealth, or their Focus vs. your Ability check. If they win the contest, they know where you're located and that you're invisible. Once they're aware of you they roughly know where you are during combat. This does not change anything about advantages or disadvantages, it simply makes attacking without guessing your position possible. 
· If an enemy is unaware of you and you're invisible to him, you have advantage on Ranged Attacks. 
· You can spend all your actions on trying to hide with another stealth or ability check, as described above. The enemy will have to win aforementioned contest or is unaware of your current location and unable to attack. If they correctly guess your position without winning said contest, they will have disadvantage on all attacks that aren't field-covering. 
· If an enemy failed aforementioned contests and are unaware of your location, they can spend an action to try and find you.

::::: RECOVERY :::::
Once in a while you will need to take some time to tend to your wounds, recover your strength and calm yourself from the heat of combat. Such a break is defined as a Rest and is bound to the following rules: 
	• A rest must take at least one hour. 
	• You can't perform any physically or mentally taxing tasks during your rest. 
Doing so will reset the time you need until your rest is finished again. 
	• You should mention when you're about to start your rest. 
	• You can also ask if you've received a rest in hindsight of downtime your characters experienced - if the GM allows for it. 

Additionally to resting, your characters also need to sleep once in a while. Having a sleepless night will give you 'Exhaustion', which will give you disadvantage on any roll your character makes. 

:: First Aid Kits ::
In your adventures you might stumble upon first aid kits. With each of these kits, you can heal 2d6 hit points before you run out of equipment, as these are merely used for the most necessary treatment before you can take a proper rest. They take two combat rounds to apply and you can only carry one at a time.

-----------------------
::::: CHARACTER CREATION :::::
You have to follow several steps to create a character that suits you. 
	1. On first level, you have 1 Action, 1 Interaction and 1 Reaction, which are closer described in the Combat Encounters page. 
	2. Pick a race that suits you and write down all your abilities and values on your character sheet that the race gives you at the level you start on. 
	3. Note down your base movement stats, as described in the Movement chapter. 
	4. Pick a class and write down all the abilities and values it adds to your base features and abilities at the level you start on. 
	5. Pick your skills. Start with 20 points at first level, with a maximum of 4 + your current level per skill. Don't forget that you can earn points back by adding up to a -3 modifier on a skill as well. 
	6. Get your equipment based on one of the starter packs and add additional items your character would carry, in consultation with your GM. 
	7. Write a background story befitting your earlier picks and write the basics of it down on your character sheet. 
	8. Hand your character-sheet and backstory to your GM and listen to what they say, implementing possible feedback. 

If you level up, check your stats in the following order: 
	1. Racial bonus features and ability scaling
	2. Class bonus features and ability and HP scaling. Re-Roll if you get a 1. 
	3. Movement scaling
	4. Weapon scaling
	5. Add 3 skill points, with a maximum value of 4 + your current level.
